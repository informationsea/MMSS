What's this?

This software can share screen and files mutually with multiple
clients and servers. I developed this to teach programming, but may be
useful for teaching, pair programming and so on.

How to use

  * Usually, MMSS will connect to a server automatically. If MMSS
    failed in automatic connection, please connect from "Connection"
    menu.
